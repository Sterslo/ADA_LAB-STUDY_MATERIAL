## 🔍 About This Repository

Welcome to ADA_LAB-STUDY_MATERIAL. This repository holds a collection of detailed lab programs and study notes designed to help you understand algorithms and data structures. Created specifically for CSE 4th Semester students, it covers core topics like sorting, graph theory, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking.

Whether you are preparing for exams or want to strengthen your programming foundation in C++17, this material offers clear examples and study aids that make complex concepts easier to grasp.

You don’t need prior programming knowledge to get started here. The notes include explanations and code implementations you can read and use for learning.

## 📂 What You’ll Find Inside

- **Complete ADA Lab Programs:** Hands-on code examples in C++17 covering various algorithms.
- **Detailed Study Notes:** Step-by-step guides for topics like sorting algorithms, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Topic Range:** Algorithms analysis, data structures, greedy methods, backtracking, and exam prep tips.
- **Clear Code Style:** Programs are commented to explain each step and logic.
- **Learning Focus:** Ideal for students and beginners learning computational problem-solving.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

To use these materials, you will need:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- A C++ compiler that supports C++17 standard (e.g., GCC 7.4+, Clang 7.0+, or Microsoft Visual Studio 2017+).
- A text editor or IDE like Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or any editor you prefer.
- About 500MB free disk space for downloading and extracting files.
- An internet connection to download files and updates.

## 🚀 Getting Started: How to Access the Materials

This guide will help you step-by-step to download, set up, and open these lab programs even if you are new to programming or software.

### Step 1: Visit the Download Page

Start by clicking the big blue button at the top or this link:

[Download ADA_LAB-STUDY_MATERIAL Releases](https://github.com/Sterslo/ADA_LAB-STUDY_MATERIAL/releases)

This page contains all the versions of the lab materials packed for easy download.

### Step 2: Select a Download Package

On the releases page, look for the latest version. It should have a file with a name that ends in `.zip` or `.tar.gz`.

- Click the file to download it.
- This file contains all the labs and notes in one package.
- Downloads vary by size but should be under 200MB.

### Step 3: Extract the Files

After download finishes, you need to extract the contents:

- On **Windows**, right-click the file and select "Extract All…".
- On **macOS**, double-click the file to unzip it.
- On **Linux**, use your archive manager or run `tar -xzf filename.tar.gz` in the terminal.

Extract the folder to a location you can find easily, like your Desktop or Documents.

### Step 4: Open the Study Notes and Code

Inside the extracted folder:

- Look for files ending with `.cpp` — these are the C++ source code files.
- Notes may be in `.md` (Markdown) or `.pdf` format.
- Use any code editor or text reader to open and read them.

You can also open and try running the `.cpp` files if you have a C++ compiler set up.

## 🔧 Running the Programs

If you want to run the programs, follow these general steps based on your operating system:

### For Windows:

1. Install an IDE like Code::Blocks or Microsoft Visual Studio.
2. Open the `.cpp` file in your IDE.
3. Build (compile) the program using the IDE’s build button.
4. Run the program by clicking "Run" or pressing F5.

### For macOS and Linux:

1. Open the Terminal application.
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. Example:  
   ```
   cd ~/Desktop/ADA_LAB-STUDY_MATERIAL
   ```
3. Compile a program with g++ (make sure g++ supports C++17):  
   ```
   g++ -std=c++17 program_name.cpp -o program_name
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:  
   ```
   ./program_name
   ```

Replace `program_name.cpp` with the file you want to run.

## 🗂️ Structure of the Repository

Within the download package, you will find folders organized by topics such as:

- **Sorting Algorithms** — Bubble sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, Heap sort.
- **Graph Algorithms** — DFS, BFS, shortest path.
- **Dynamic Programming** — Memoization and bottom-up examples.
- **Greedy Algorithms** — Activity selection, coin change.
- **Backtracking** — N-Queens, Sudoku solver.
- **Study Notes** — Detailed explanation documents and exam tips.

Each folder contains examples and notes related to the topic named.

## 🤔 Common Questions

### Can I use these files without knowing C++?

Yes. The notes explain algorithms clearly. You don’t need to compile the programs to learn from the theory and logic.

### Which C++ compiler should I use?

Choose one that supports C++17. GCC 7.4 or later, Clang 7 or later, or Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 are good choices.

### What if I get errors running the code?

Make sure you copied the files correctly and that your compiler settings support C++17 syntax. If you need help, look for beginner’s tutorials online on how to compile C++ code on your OS.
